#1. Write a program to print a multiplication table by taking the number, start, stop and step from the user as input.
num=int(input("Enter number:"))
start=int(input("Starting range:"))
stop=int(input("Ending range:"))
step=int(input("Step count:"))
for i in range(start,stop+1,step):
    print(num,"x",i,"=",num*i)
    
0utput:
Enter number:6
Starting range:1
Ending range:10
Step count:1
6 x 1 = 6
6 x 2 = 12
6 x 3 = 18
6 x 4 = 24
6 x 5 = 30
6 x 6 = 36
6 x 7 = 42
6 x 8 = 48
6 x 9 = 54
6 x 10 = 60



#2. Write a program that accepts start and stop as input from users and print if numbers from start to stop are:
a. positive or zero or negative.
start=int(input("Starting range:"))
stop=int(input("Ending range:"))
step=int(input("Step count:"))
for i in range(start,stop+1,step):
    if i > 0:
       print(i,"it is positive number")
    elif i == 0:
       print(i,"it is Zero")
    elif i < 0:
       print(i,"it is a negative number")
       
 output:
 Starting range:-9
Ending range:2
Step count:2
-9 it is a negative number
-7 it is a negative number
-5 it is a negative number
-3 it is a negative number
-1 it is a negative number
1 it is positive number
> 
 
 #b. if positive then it should also print even or odd number
start=int(input("Starting range:"))
stop=int(input("Ending range:"))
step=int(input("Step count:"))
s=0
for i in range(start,stop+1,step):
        if i%2== 0:
           print(i,"it is even")
           s+=i
        else:
           print(i,"it is odd")
           s+=i
print("The sum of all numbers is ",s)
    
output:
Starting range:4
Ending range:10
Step count:3
4 it is even
7 it is odd
10 it is even
The sum of all numbers is  21
> 

#3. Write a program that accepts start, stop, step and limit as input from the user and print cube of each number starting from start and ending at limit but not at stop.
start=int(input("Starting range:"))
stop=int(input("Ending range:"))
step=int(input("Step count:"))
limit=int(input("Limit:"))
for i in range(start,stop+1,step):
    if i>limit:
        break
    print("The cube of the number",i,"is:",i*i*i)
    
output:
Starting range:3
Ending range:9
Step count:1
Limit:5
The cube of the number 3 is: 27
The cube of the number 4 is: 64
The cube of the number 5 is: 125
